## Virtual Private Network(VPN)

> **ISP : Internet Service Provider**

It creates an **encrypted tunnel** between:

> Your device ←→ VPN server ←→ Internet

so ; 

- Your ISP can’t see what you visit
    
- Websites see VPN IP, not your real IP
    
- Traffic becomes private and secure

```

SSL : Secure Socket Layer 
SSL Inspection

##  How VPN Actually Works

1. You connect to VPN app
    
2. App creates encrypted tunnel
    
3. All traffic goes to VPN server first
    
4. VPN server forwards to website
    
5. Reply comes back through tunnel
