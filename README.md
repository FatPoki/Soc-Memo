## Networking
This section covers fundamental networking concepts required for SOC such as the OSI model, TCP/IP workflow, common ports and protocols, NAT, DNS, and the difference between routers, switches, and firewalls.

## Wireshark
This section focuses on packet analysis using Wireshark, including traffic inspection, TCP handshake verification, DNS analysis, and identifying malicious communication patterns.

## Linux + Logs
This section includes Linux fundamentals and log analysis skills such as navigating log directories, understanding system and authentication logs, and using command-line tools for investigations.

## SOC Fundamentals
This section explains core SOC concepts like the CIA triad, incident response lifecycle, MITRE ATT&CK framework, malware types, and the difference between IDS, IPS, and EDR.

## SIEM + Email Security
This section covers SIEM operations, log correlation, alert triage, and email security topics including phishing analysis, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, and email header investigation.

## Cloud & Cloud Security
This section introduces cloud security concepts such as IAM, shared responsibility model, cloud logging, misconfiguration risks, and basic AWS and Azure security monitoring.

## Detection Engineering Mindset
This section focuses on developing attacker-mindset detections, mapping activity to MITRE techniques, writing alert rules, and reducing false positives.

## Automation
This section covers automation for SOC using scripting and SOAR concepts to enrich alerts, extract IOCs, and reduce manual repetitive tasks.
